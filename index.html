            <!-- Sample paragraphs-->
            <p class="space-paragraph">
                The vast expanse of space has always captivated human imagination and curiosity. From the mysteries of black holes to the possibility of 
                extraterrestrial life, the universe is full of unanswered questions. Scientists continue to explore space to unlock the secrets of the 
                cosmos, with new discoveries being made regularly. <span class="underline" id="first-thesis">Despite the immense progress we have made in space exploration, there is still so much 
                    we have yet to uncover, making the study of space an exciting and ever-evolving field.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="space-paragraph">
                One of the most intriguing phenomena in space is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" id="black-hole-link"><strong class="text-capitalize">black holes</strong></a>. These are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that 
                nothing, not even light, can escape. Scientists are still working to understand the nature of black holes, but their existence has been 
                confirmed by observing their effects on nearby objects. Studying black holes can help us understand the universe's evolution and provide 
                insights into the fundamental laws of physics.
            </p>
            <p class="space-paragraph">
                Another area of interest in space exploration is the search for extraterrestrial life. Scientists believe that there are potentially habitable 
                planets in other star systems that could support life as we know it. They are using telescopes and other technologies to detect signs of life 
                outside our solar system. While we have not yet discovered any definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life, the possibility is still exciting, 
                and the search continues.
            </p>
            <p class="space-paragraph">
                In conclusion, space is an endless frontier of mysteries and discoveries waiting to be made. By exploring and studying the universe, we can
                 deepen our understanding of the world around us and gain new insights into our place in the cosmos. The wonders of space will continue to
                  inspire us to push the limits of human exploration and discovery.

            <p class="space-paragraph second">
                Space exploration has numerous benefits for society, both in terms of scientific advancement and practical applications. By studying space, 
                scientists can gain new knowledge and insights into the world around us. <span class="underline" id="second-thesis">Space exploration has led to numerous technological advancements, 
                    including the development of new materials and technologies that have practical applications in various industries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="space-paragraph second">
                One area in which space exploration has had a significant impact is in the field of telecommunications. Satellites are used to relay signals 
                around the world, providing us with instant communication and access to information. The development of satellite technology has also revolutionized 
                navigation systems, making them more accurate and reliable.
            </p>
            <p class="space-paragraph second">
                Another area in which space exploration has had an impact is in the field of medicine. The study of space has helped researchers better understand 
                the human body's response to extreme conditions, such as zero gravity. This research has led to the development of new medical technologies and treatments, 
                including new drugs and therapies for a variety of conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="space-paragraph second">
                In conclusion, space exploration has numerous benefits for society, from scientific advancement to practical applications in various fields. By continuing 
                to explore and study space, we can deepen our understanding of the universe and gain new insights into our place in it. The innovations and technologies 
                developed through space exploration will continue to benefit society for years to come.
